# Given that a birth has a occurred, probability distribution over the    
# age of the mother. This is generated from ABS age-specific fertility rates,   
# essentially rescaling them. Theoretically, this is incorrect, as       
# age-specific fertilty rates are expressed as "# births occuring to women of 
# age x" divided by "number of women of age x" However, given that the age
# distribution is relatively flat over the relevant age range, rescaled     
# fertility rates serve as a very close approximation.       
#               
# columns:              
# 0=probability              
# 1=age
